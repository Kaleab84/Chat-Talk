WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Yeah.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Record has been started. Yes. Yeah, thank you so much.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This should be recorded. And if you can like send me the recording after this meeting, I'll be right.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Sure.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Thank you so much. All right, please. Thank you.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Yeah. So, you know, and how I got here from our main menu, you've got all these different options and you've got some common options that are listed on the main screen as well as more of them that are listed with these down these drop down menus.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So for you mentioned ingredients, kind of starting out with ingredients.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We had poultry meal open so that here's where you would see where you can see the ingredients that you have in the program.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So this will be all the ingredients that are in the database.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You can you can add or remove any ingredients that you want. You can give them whatever code that you want to.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And then you can track whatever nutrients that you want. So we don't the program does not dictate to you what code is used for moisture or dry matter or protein or fat or any nutrients or what unit of measure is being used.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:40.000
It's completely up to you what what nutrients that you that you have in the program, how you organize them, what units of measure you use and of course what values you use.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So, and then, depending on on your on your business, you may have more than one manufacturing facility but at a minimum you're going to have one manufacturing facility or plant as the program term is used.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And then you're going to have your is your cost that would be for for that particular ingredient at that plant. There's two default costs one called owning and one called market.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:18.000
There's really nothing different about owning versus market. As far as the program is concerned, it's just one cost versus another could be cost number one and cost number two, but they're called owning and market.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Now, this this information, of course, you know you as a user would maintain.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And then, when you work with a formula.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:41.000
You've got several different methods you can use I'm not see if I've got any freeze dried products, probably all.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.000
They're probably all products that are that are conventional.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
See if we got some freeze dried stuff.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
But it's, it's going to be kind of the same.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:08.000
You know, there's there again there's the program technically doesn't know or care if it's freeze dried or if it's extruded or if it's just raw mix or if it's pelleted.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:24.000
You know, of course, there are some considerations if you do process a diet and and there's a moisture change in that diet.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
But for freeze dried for the most part or freeze was it freeze dried or just fresh rose.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
It's freeze dried freeze dried so there is there is some moisture change then.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Yes, in the diet.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Okay, that that does that that does come into play. Although, it's my understanding of freeze dried that there's not multiple processes involved.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000
It's basically you mix all your ingredients together. They undergo this freeze drying process and then they're and then they're packaged right.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Yes.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
So so they lose moisture. All the ingredients lose moisture basically together.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Not in multiple stages, and there's not a like a draw a cooling and a drying and an extruding and a heating and a baking or any of those kinds of process.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
There is a shooting involved.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Okay.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Are you talking about the extruding after freeze drying or before freeze dry.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Well, however, what what either way what what what process do you guys use what what what happens in your in your type of products.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Typically we extrude before freeze drying machine.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
So we just mix the raw material extrude then put in the freeze drying machine.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So does that will affect anything in the C5.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Well, it potentially

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:13.000
different tools that are available, depending on on on what you what your process looks like.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Let me ask you this when you when you extrude the product.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
You're taking a mixture of ingredients raw materials and you're extruding them.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So are you adding to those ingredients or to that product after extrusion right you are you adding any additional ingredients after extrusion.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
No, no, we are not.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Okay, so there's no spray on fats or or palatins or anything like that that are added.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Does it go into like a, but might not really matter if it goes in any kind of pre drying or cooling or anything or if it goes right into the freezer.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Basically what happens is after it comes out of the extruder you're losing more moisture, right.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:15.000
It's just a method that you're using to losing that moisture.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:26.000
The program can handle these different scenarios these different manufacturing scenarios.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:40.000
What it boils down to is, if that's a little more complicated, which this is not too bad but I mean there's some there is some degree of complexity here because you're losing moisture.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:50.000
There's tools that can make it easier. It's not saying that it can't be done but it but there are tools that does make that they do make things easier. Unfortunately, those tools can be kind of expensive.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And I really don't I'm not I'm not convinced that you guys would need them.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:15.000
The tool that I'm referring to is called multi step. And the idea behind multi step is it lets you established established not only the raw materials that can that you know are going to be used in the solution, but also the manufacturing process so for instance, in like in a

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
traditional extruded product.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
You've got probably at what they might call a dry mix so they've got the dry ingredients.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Any kind of maybe vitamin trace mineral premixes those types of things that are added in the dry mix, and then they add moisture to that.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:50.000
So that's what we're going to do. We're going to put in the form of water and or in the pre conditioner of the extruder. So now the moisture content of that mixture goes up.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And at that particular point it probably doesn't really matter as you can actually kind of consider that moisture.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And then it's going to just change, you know, the weight of the mixture at that particular point in time and also the nutrient content of that mixture, once that what moisture is added, and then my grocery extruder and it's going to and it's going to lose some

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:33.000
moisture in the drying process afterwards which is similar to what you guys do in that you know the drying process that that conventionally that you one would think of of course would be, you know, heat, right, you stick it in

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:47.000
or even just air to cool it and have air applied to it and dry it down and then a lot of times there's a further operation where they add palatins or fats and things of that nature.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:09:09.000
So, since the moisture is being changed at different stages of the mixing process your nutrient content goes up and it goes down because it gets less concentrated or more concentrated diluted or concentrated during those processes and that affects your end nutrient content.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:18.000
So when you define what you want your nutrient value and the pounds of ingredient that you use, there's going to be yield consideration right.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:31.000
The pounds of ingredient that you use you might use 2150 pounds of raw material to get a 2000 pound ton of finished product.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Right.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Because you lose you lose some of the weight in the form of moisture.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:55.000
So, so when you define what you want your nutrient content to be that definition needs to be on that on that finished dry matter basis as opposed to what one might call the as mixed basis fear just take all the ingredients and mix them together and put them in a big pot.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:06.000
You know, your, your moisture content might be 30% moisture and maybe it's, you know, 18% crude protein.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:13.000
But then when you dry it down to whatever the process is you dry it down to seven and a half.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Well, now you've concentrated that protein and now you're maybe a 21% protein.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Right.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:32.000
So, so it can get tricky telling the program, you know what your requirement is on on the as mixed basis versus on a finished dry matter or target dry matter basis.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And that for that that that is further compounded.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:50.000
If that moisture loss occurs to some ingredients but not all because of where the where in the process that moisture change occurs, like at the extruder or the dryer.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
So that can that can create some challenges.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Now, the formulation program concept five, you know, is originally created for the animal feed industry back however long ago, right back in the 70s and 80s.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:25.000
So when when you look at at a screen where you define what your requirements are for for animal feed that you basically just mix up the ingredients and don't go any through any processing, save for maybe a pellet mill at the most.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:34.000
You would define the nutrients on this screen here where you just have a nutrient number and amount and that that assumes that it's as is or as mixed.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
But with pet food.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:52.000
What ends up having to happen is you define those requirements on a on a dry matter basis or a or not a not a 100% dry matter but a target dry matter basis.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:00.000
So for instance, in this case, rather than having the minimum on this screen, you have the minimum over here established as a ratio.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And I know that kind of sounds a little bit different.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:21.000
It ratio could mean like a calcium to phosphorus ratio, for instance, or it could mean a ratio of a certain nutrient to dry matter, because dry matter is handled for the most part, just like any other nutrient, not 100% like any other nutrient.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
But for for a lot of the math, most of the math is like any other nutrients.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:43.000
So rather than saying you want X amount of protein in the finished diet, you can you would say I want this much protein per per a certain amount of dry matter per 91% dry matter.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:51.000
So in this case, I what I'm saying is that this particular product, when it's in the bag, I want it to be 9% moisture.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
That's kind of high moisture level, but you know, that's, it's just an example.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:02.000
So my minimum here says 22 per 91% dry matter.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And for the way that you guys manufacture from what I'm hearing you tell me, I think this is this would this method would be sufficient.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:19.000
You wouldn't have to use, as you'll notice here, there's no differentiation for these ingredients as to where they get added.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
You know, it's just, it's just this, this is a mixture of ingredients.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:35.000
There's nothing, nothing defined right here that says this these ingredients get added first and then these ingredients get added, or these ingredients go through extruder or something like that.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:44.000
It's just all a mixture of ingredients, you know, with the assumption that they all get mixed together undergo the same process together.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Okay, so from what I'm from what I'm hearing you tell me that's what you do.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Yes.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Um, okay, so basically, I just want to clear something up.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:14.000
We can do like, we can set a target outcome and see five will able to read like recalculate like how much does it how much corn do we need like how much soy meal do we need or how much salt does they need to add is that is that correct.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Am I understanding correctly?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Yes.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Yep, that's correct.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:29.000
So basically based on a cost basis, as well as the nutrient, you know, just as important if not more important really especially with pet food is on a nutrient basis.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Here's, you know, the, the, the nutrient concentration that you'll have based on this mixture of ingredients.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:48.000
And those those nutrient requirements can be either minimums or maximums or both.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Okay, you might have some requirements that are both a min and max you want at least as much but not more than than that much.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Got it.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
So let me ask you a question.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000
So we are able to like set a value like outcome value.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Let's say we want a formula that's 3000 calorie 20% or 30% protein 20% fat, whatever percent fiber and all the calcium phosphate like everything we can put like our like what we aim at and the price.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:31.000
And the software recalculated based on based on our final result.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Correct.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Yes, except for you met you did mention price.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:51.000
The program is always going to provide you with a solution that is that is the least expensive mixture.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Okay, okay, got it.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000
That's great.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Yeah, you know, you know, you don't tell it hey, you know, give me a mixture that's $100 a ton.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
It's, it's going to it's going to make it as as low as it can, if it can get.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Yeah, if it can get lower it will if it can't then it then it won't.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Okay, and the.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:22.000
So we can select the ingredients or like we just select what ingredients we want to use and we put basically we're putting the outcome result.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:39.000
So we want to use then the software will calculate from our outcome by using the required ingredients that we provided to software and will calculate coming percent of product need to be mixed to achieve the final result.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
With the lowest.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
That that is that is an accurate description of the process.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Yep, you go.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Okay, okay.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Yep.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:17:03.000
And it does get a little bit, you know, more flexible you've, you know, you the the ingredients to for instance what you're seeing right here is a list of what we call offered ingredients.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000
So it's a these ingredients are or sometimes you might hear us use the terminology of controlled.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
So fish meal for instance is a controlled ingredient that means that even though there's no minute max on it.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
It's it's it's in them.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
It's in the mathematics.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Right.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
It's offered in the math.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:28.000
So in this case, there's no minute no max on fish meal and none is coming in.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
And in this soy meal, there's no minute no max, but but there is some coming in.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
So so these these are all controlled ingredients.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
There's a lot more ingredients in the database.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
There's many, many, many, you can have as many as you want.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:59.000
But these but you're what you're what when you when you add an ingredient to the product specification as a controlled ingredient, you're saying, here's an ingredient you can use if you want, or here's an ingredient that must be used that you know at this minimum and no more at that

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000
maximum.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Okay.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
For a minimum maximum, can you do like by percentage or it has to be in pound.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Yeah, you can do by percent.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Okay, that's great.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
You can toggle back and forth between percent and pounds.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:25.000
And what we've discovered in having actually myself, I used to be a formulator back in my early days in the animal feed industry and some people think in percent.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Right.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
And personally, I was trained and became a formula, I think in pounds.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:40.000
So if you told me that a formula had 500 pounds of wheat mids in it, I would know what that product would look like.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
You know, I would understand.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:49.000
But if you told me that it had 25% that that is more of a leap for me to understand I don't.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:57.000
So, so yeah, you can because of that because people some people think in percent and something in pounds you can switch back and forth.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:09.000
And let's say, but we can also switch orders right let's say today I want to make a formulation that is based on beef liver, but but I find our beef liver is way too expensive.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
So I'm going to use a beef lung as additive.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
So like, like we can switch the order.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Bring in this can be like beef livers.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
But tomorrow I was like, oh, let's let's move the beef lung as the top.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:38.000
We could do that inside of software and they will recalculate like how much percent of like how much percent needed or to how much percent needed to achieve the let's say 30% protein.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
They can do that right the software are able to.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Well the program is like I can switch around the ingredients list and cat and the software will recalculate it based on my new ingredient list.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Well, when you say ingredient list.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
You mean the the order of ingredients which ones are the highest user you.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Yeah, that that of course.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Excuse me.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
The program is going to give you the cheapest solution.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Right.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Let's say that I wanted wheat mids to be first on the list, meaning that I want more wheat mids than corn, right.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
The program if I don't put any men's or max is on on either of those two ingredients.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.000
The program is going to is going to tell me which ingredient to use and how much.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Okay.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
So, so in this case, well, I took the maximum off and now use more wheat mids.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Let's say in this scenario, let's say that we wanted to the other way around.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Let's say that we wanted corn to be first, right.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
There's no manner no max on either ingredient.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000
The program is going to tell me that corn has to be second, not first.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:16.000
If I want corn to be first, then I either need to put a minimum on corn that that forces it in at a higher rate or a maximum on wheat meds that forces wheat meds down, which is the way it was before, so that it doesn't use as much.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000
So that that is one way that you can control the order of ingredients is by putting on and max is on things.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:30.000
The other thing that you can that you can do is you can you can use ingredient ratios.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:43.000
So in the the the intended use of ingredient ratios is so that you you might want there to be a corn to mids ratio, or you might want there to be two like a fish.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
You might want anchovies to cod ratio, right?

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Yeah, whatever.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:57.000
But you can also use that as a method to to define an ingredient order.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:06.000
And let me see if I've got an example already set up. I don't have to go through the. Yeah, here we go. Let's see if this one does.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Does the job.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Creating ratios.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
It says ingredient order, but it doesn't.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Sometimes my data gets a little bit beat up.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Is that because like, is he doing a lot of demos or.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Yeah, because I'm doing demos or I'm testing or whatever.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Okay.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
You know, here's here's an example. So.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:49.000
This what I'm what I what I want to happen in this solution is I want my ingredient order to be corn first and then wheat, mids and then meat and bone meal and then soy and then gluten.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:58.000
So the way that I control that is I say that I want corn to be one for every one of mids.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:09.000
And then I want mids to be one, a minimum of one could be more, a minimum of one for every one of meat and bone meal. See how it kind of it steps down through.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:16.000
You got corn and then mids and then mids and then meat and then meat and then soy.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:23.000
So, so I've said that I want at least 1.01 that so that there's just a little bit more. I could make it one point.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:29.000
I see, I see, I see what you mean. So, in there just show corn is more than wheat.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:38.000
That has to be more than 1.1 more than wheat and wheat has to be more than I see so it goes down.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Right. So, so the solution is going to come back and go well you know I'd like to use more mids but if I do I have to make sure that the corn is at least one or 1.01% of what the mids are right.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:04.000
So, if we look at the solution, we'll see that the ingredient list, you know, it's got it's got corn first, you know, barely, and then meat and bone meal and then

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:18.000
the other ingredients I don't know if we had fat listed in there probably should have been if it wasn't no fat wasn't listed so fat didn't get that's not in the quay in the in the list but I should have listed it.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:26.000
So, so that would then if you put minimums and maximums on here.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000
You're telling the program to use an exact amount.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Okay, to force it to be more than another ingredient.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:48.000
But, but what, but you as a user might not necessarily know what that optimum amount should be in relation to another ingredient.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:59.000
So, if you just tell basically the the the program hey, use as much corn or or mids as you want just make sure that there's more corn than mids.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:07.000
And then it will pick what that optimum amount should be for the both of them or all four of them or five of them combined.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Right.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:22.000
So, so yeah, that's how. And there again, see what we're doing what I'm showing you is is we could call it the single step version of formulation.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:38.000
And that's not that's not what we've what we call it because it was kind of it came first it was always this way until we created the multi step function with the multi step formulation tool.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:51.000
You don't have to create these ratios as kind of a trick to control the order of ingredients there's a there's a tool that there's a there's a feature that says, you know what's the order of ingredients.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:01.000
You define that order of ingredients. And in a basically mathematically does the same thing but it's from a user standpoint it's a little more obvious.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:11.000
For instance, this is what it would look like ingredient order right.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
So you just say corn and mids then rice and right.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
And then when you're creating a ratio, you just say here's what the order looks like.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:30.000
So, so yeah, you can you can do it with single step but multi step makes it a little bit easier.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Multi step, you tell it what your, your percent of your solution looks like when it's done when it's finished.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:49.000
So you put in your nutrient requirements, those nutrient requirements are at 9.5% moisture, not the as mixed.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:58.000
So rather than having to do a nutrient ratio of protein to dry matter, you just say well here's what I want my protein to be when we're done.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:06.000
So you can you can use multi step to be a little more.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:21.000
It's it's designed to to handle the the formulas that you're, you know that undergo these kind of moisture changes and but you don't necessarily it doesn't mean that you can't do it with single step.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:36.000
It just means that with single step, you have to go through a few extra a few extra steps in the program in order to come up with the same or close to the same result.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:28:03.000
And the reason that that I would suggest that you consider single step over top of using multi step is that you would gain that those those ease of use things but it really wouldn't change the answer any or at all to save you like money for for your solutions

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:19.000
you want to make cheaper solutions for you. So it's really not is really there's really not going to be a direct monetary payback, just for being a little bit easier to use and understand the the multi step function does a lot more.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:29.000
In addition to what you know we've just talked about, and therefore it comes with a with a pretty high price tag it basically more than doubles the price of the license.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:38.000
So in your case, I don't know if I don't think it would be worth your money to spend on it. You know what I mean.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Yeah, now, in the future, if you guys start making different types of products, if it becomes real parent that yeah we're going to need that tool, you can always add it later.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Okay.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:29:14.000
But even if you did need it. A lot of times we still suggest that you wait because it's also a lot more difficult to use and a lot more difficult to learn. And it's better sometimes to learn with just the single step and the simpler method, and then graduating kind of towards the towards the more

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
complicated formulation tool.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Okay, got it.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:32.000
So first, so if I only use the first I need to go to mutual ratios, put the desired minimum maximum in there.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Then go to ingredients and add all the ingredients that we want to use for us for the formulations.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Then it will calculate the lowest price of formulations.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Is that correct?

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Yeah, it'll calculate the lowest price or lowest cost mixture of ingredients to meet your the parameters that you've defined.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:13.000
Okay, got it. And if we want to switch the list, because I'm not always, you know, sometimes you don't want to use the whole list.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:28.000
So if you want to change the nutrients, like the ingredients panel, we go to the mutual ratio in there. I need to set, let's I need to set this ingredients, ingredients A is more than ingredients B.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:36.000
And they will recalculate how much do we need for this ingredients, for this formulations.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Right.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Yep.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Okay.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:46.000
So, for a product or just in the database in general?

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
In the database.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:55.000
So in the database in general, the under this ingredient maintenance function.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
Okay.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
You have your list of all the ingredients that are currently in the database.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Right.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000
And to add another ingredient, you just would click on add new ingredient.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:13.000
You assign that ingredient to code. And then you give it a name and cost and so forth.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Okay. And for a formula.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:24.000
That's a very similar process when you're looking at the main formula or product screen, there's an add a new product.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:38.000
And, and what you'll probably find is that it will be, it will be rare that you will use that you will add a new product by clicking on the add new product.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Most formulators and nutritionists.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
And it's not because they're lazy, it's because they're smart.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
They start with one that that's close to what they already have.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Right.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Otherwise you're starting with a completely blank slate.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:03.000
And you've got to add all the information in manually, but if you start with something that's close to what you're already making and then just save do a save as you can give it a new product code.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:11.000
And then you can make the modifications to this product to make to make it unique to make it new.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Yeah, either either way you could either do a save as, or if you wanted to start from scratch with from ground zero with the blank slate, well then you would just click on add new product and give it a product code.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:32.000
And then you'd have to give it a name and you'd have to go to the, you know, to the screen where you add what ingredients are available, what the requirements are and so forth.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Okay, so could you show me like let's say if I don't want to read number 40, I'll delete number 40.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:56.000
And then you can add the ingredient. Yeah. Okay, so yeah, so when you're working with a, when you're working in it, when you're working in the program in general, there's you're going to you're going to see an edit, and if you're an edit thing I see an on and edit.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000
And that's to kind of keep you.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:14.000
That's to keep you focused on what you're performing and what you're doing on that screen, and also make sure that the program is on the same page with you so like okay I'm making an edit.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:24.000
And then when you're done. Okay I've clearly I'm clearly done editing and making modifications and then it'll say you've made some modifications do you want to store it.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:35.000
And that's the thing that people have the biggest hurdle, a learning is to remember to click that edit because you might go hey it's not it's not let me do anything that's because they haven't clicked the edit button.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:53.000
So you click edit, and then to make a modification to an ingredient or to remove an ingredient. Now the thing is with removing ingredients is in order to to maintain database integrity.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000
And you, you can't just.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:18.000
There's some extra steps, if you just simply delete an ingredient, because this this the program has stored this particular product with 33 pound or 33% of ingredient number 40 wheat myths right.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:27.000
And then suddenly you said wheat myths is no longer in this formula. Well we can't have just a whole. Right.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:46.000
You're, you're, so if you, if you remove or delete an ingredient without telling the without assigning or reformulating an ingredient to replace that in the ingredient that you've removed.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
And that's going to say well the rest of the formula is no longer valid.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.000
The specs and everything will still be there won't be moved the product, but it's going to say that you know what.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Now the answer is no longer valid because in order to come up with the answer that was there, we assume that you could get wheat myths.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Now that we have we can't put in wheat meds now the whole it's a whole new mathematical problem.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:22.000
So if we remove wheat meds, we're going to remove the entire solution we're going to remove all the numbers in this column right here, and tell you reformulate and come up with a new answer that doesn't use wheat meds.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:31.000
So the process would probably look more if you wanted to kind of maintain housekeeping a little bit and maintain what that old formula look like.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.000
You probably would be more inclined to say well that's just suppress that ingredient.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:46.000
So what a suppress is is saying you know the ingredient is still in the specification it's still a controlled ingredient, but don't use it.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Okay, so it doesn't remove it it just says for future use your wheat meds is no longer available.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Now once we once we've suppressed it and reformulated.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Now we come up with a new answer now. Unfortunately, what this is telling me is that well we can't we can't come up with a solution.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:25.000
If we don't at least have wheat meds available. So we're going to have to offer something else like ground bakery let's see. Let's see what happens if we offer that still infeasible, and it might be infeasible because of ratios.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:37.000
So this is why it's infeasible because we've said there has to be one pound of wheat meds for every pound of meat and bone meal of wheat meds is no longer available.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:44.000
So we're going to have to remove wheat meds from this.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
And now we'll probably be feasible again. Yeah.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:37:01.000
So now we so now wheat meds is no longer used and if we if we click on this, this tab over here, we can see that the solution that was stored previously.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000
He was 32.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Sorry, he was 32%.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:17.000
Almost 33% wheat meds. This solution doesn't use any so there's a difference of 32.593.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000
Got it.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:27.000
And in addition to this, can you guys are you guys able to calculate the density of each product.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Well,

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:48.000
yes, if you have accurate density values that that are not affected by particle size.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:59.000
But you can get an approximation. The reason I that I hedge that a little bit is because density is a nonlinear thing. Yes.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Right.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:13.000
That whole experiment where you can fill a jar full of rocks and then you can put in it's not really full because you can put marbles because and then it's not really full you can put sand and then you know what I mean.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:22.000
So, so, so, so outside of that consideration.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000
It's just like another nutrient.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000
But it's able to like display it.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:45.000
It would display it like it would protein or fat or fiber you could have a density density nutrient and it would be the value would be linear because you're not able to program in the nonlinear aspect of, you know, any kind of particle size

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
relationship, which would affect the true density. Okay.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Okay, got it, got it.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:04.000
But it does give you a pretty close approximation, especially if you process your ingredients in such a way before mixing them where they have a similar particle size and shape.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Okay, okay.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:11.000
The fertilizer industry does that quite a bit.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:30.000
And they really go through great pains to to process all of their ingredients like the nitrogen the ammonium the urea the so that they all have a very similar particle size and shaped or like little round BBs little pellets, so that when they mix them

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:39.000
they get a homogenous mixture that they can come to a close approximation on density.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000
In order to because the way that they apply it is with.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000
It's a volumetric application.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
Okay, got it.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:40:01.000
Yeah, you probably don't maybe care about that but I don't answer I don't I don't always answer that question yes no problem because

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000
just humans.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:12.000
Yeah, it's it's it's a nonlinear parameter and everything in the formulation program it has a linear relationship.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000
Got it got it got it.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Oh, I see.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:37.000
And then come close it you know there's been the animal feed industry has put in things like, you know, pellet durability index values density, I've seen density, you know, just so that they can at least get close.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:50.000
But there's so many interrelationships and of course if you get any kind of chemical reactions going on because of processing and stuff that that that's not programmed into a linear model.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000
Okay, got it got it.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:00.000
Um, yeah, I don't I think you're.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Yeah, well thank you so much.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:20.000
You're very welcome. Yeah, if you have other questions or I don't know if Mark offered or mentioned to you that you can get a trial, a free 30 day trial of the program so you can start experimenting with you know your solutions your actual information.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000
If you do do that and you enter in data.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:38.000
That data stays with with you. So if you decide he had like to buy the program, you know that data that you've maybe have entered in in the 30 days or however long it takes.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:49.000
It will remain you won't you won't lose it. If you if you would have happened to have been using or maybe have access to a database.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:58.000
So if you want to use for the for this trial period we can convert the data or load that that data in for you.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:12.000
And which which could sometimes can help because you know your trial period is spent with real live data rather than trying to imagine what it might look like using demonstration data.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:18.000
For the data are we able to like you mentioned we can import it.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.000
And we both import and export data from this software.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:36.000
Yeah, there's quite a bit of different importing and exporting type functionality in the in the program and it and of course does require that you know they the layout of that information matches.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.000
The assumed layout of that import or export process.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:55.000
There's probably more exporting type capabilities, because there's usually more exporting requirements than importing a lot of times the formulation programs because becomes kind of the point of origination for some data.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000
You know.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000
So I mean, basically likes, which is a nice way of saying it's hand entered.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Because, because that's where it starts.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:21.000
But yeah, I mean if you've got a laboratory where that has an export of data is sometimes the important ingredient nutrient values ingredient costs are probably the most common piece of information that gets imported in.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000
And then of course the formulations are usually what you would export.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:36.000
Either to a third party, you know, another program for accounting or batching automated batching inventory, process control that type of thing.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:51.000
All kinds of options are there's like right from right from here there's a nice, what we call copy export copy function that you let you generate right when you're working with a formula.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:44:15.000
So it would be formula type data, you can either export it to a CSV file or copy it to clipboard and you kind of have some options as to what information you want to be exported or copied to your clipboard and then that gets copied to your clipboard in such a way that you could just paste it into Excel and it would go into the data would go into cells.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:26.000
And you have to be careful because if you're generating a report and say hey I want to I want to create a copy of that report or I want to create a text file that report.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:33.000
That's just textual data that has no delineation as to what information is in different fields.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:43.000
So if you pasted that into something like Excel, it would all go into one cell basically or you'd have to create some type of import template.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:45:04.000
There's different there's some differences in in exporting methods that depending on how you want to use that information if you just wanted to copy a report and paste it into a Word document or an email or something then you could do that with like just a you know pasting or copying a report.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000
Got it.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:13.000
For when we input when we input our ingredients in there let's say beef.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Are you are we able to like also attach a like COA or the like other documentations in there or not.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
No, no.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:44.000
So just pure data like like like you maybe what would yeah it's just pure data like you maybe want would want with the ingredient data. That's an interesting you know that's not that makes sense we've never been asked that before but yeah like you maybe you had attached files attached to that one that one ingredient.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000
That would be a.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000
I could see that as being a useful thing.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.000
Yeah, it's easier for you know to match all the ingredients so we can.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
Yeah, documentation.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000
Sure.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
That's a good idea.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000
I'm going to write that down.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Thank you.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Is there anything else that you needed from us from at this point of time.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:23.000
No, not really I mean it's all it's all about you really I mean what do you guys need.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:36.000
You know, you know, so you know, depending on you know what you wanted want to do if you if you're going to wait a little bit or if you want to pursue it on a trial basis or what.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:50.000
You know, we'll be happy to work with you we know sometimes it's a process and it takes time or maybe you guys you know you want to propose we want costs and stuff you want to get moving on right away whatever whatever you guys want to do there.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Okay, let us know.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
Yeah, if you can.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Well thank you so much for for today and thank you for what.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:09.000
If you could send us the recording we'll review it and I will get back to you and how I'll get back to you or Mark.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Okay.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000
Thank you.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:20.000
I'm glad you reminded me about the recordings I almost forgot we were recording but yeah I'll I'll I'll make sure I save that recording.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000
Yeah, yeah, please.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.000
Thank you so much.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:33.000
You bet well thanks for your time been nice chat with you guys and I hope we can, we can do something to help you to meet your needs one way or another.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Thank you so much.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
You bet take care.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000
Bye bye.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
you
