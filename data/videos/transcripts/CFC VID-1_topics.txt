Topic Summary

1. Section (0:00:00–0:09:55)
- Yeah.
- And the idea behind multi step is it lets you established established not only the raw materials that can that you know are going to be used in the solution, but also the manufacturing process so for instance, in like in a  traditional extruded product.
- And then it's going to just change, you know, the weight of the mixture at that particular point in time and also the nutrient content of that mixture, once that what moisture is added, and then my grocery extruder and it's going to and it's going to lose some  moisture in the drying process afterwards which is similar to what you guys do in that you know the drying process that that conventionally that you one would think of of course would be, you know, heat, right, you stick it in  or even just air to cool it and have air applied to it and dry it down and then a lot of times there's a further operation where they add palatins or fats and things of that nature.
- So, so when you define what you want your nutrient content to be that definition needs to be on that on that finished dry matter basis as opposed to what one might call the as mixed basis fear just take all the ingredients and mix them together and put them in a big pot.

- You know, your, your moisture content might be 30% moisture and maybe it's, you know, 18% crude protein.
- So when when you look at at a screen where you define what your requirements are for for animal feed that you basically just mix up the ingredients and don't go any through any processing, save for maybe a pellet mill at the most.
- Let's say we want a formula that's 3000 calorie 20% or 30% protein 20% fat, whatever percent fiber and all the calcium phosphate like everything we can put like our like what we aim at and the price.
- So we want to use then the software will calculate from our outcome by using the required ingredients that we provided to software and will calculate coming percent of product need to be mixed to achieve the final result.

3. Section (0:19:52–0:29:51)
- Well, when you say ingredient list.
- So, if we look at the solution, we'll see that the ingredient list, you know, it's got it's got corn first, you know, barely, and then meat and bone meal and then  the other ingredients I don't know if we had fat listed in there probably should have been if it wasn't no fat wasn't listed so fat didn't get that's not in the quay in the in the list but I should have listed it.
- And the reason that that I would suggest that you consider single step over top of using multi step is that you would gain that those those ease of use things but it really wouldn't change the answer any or at all to save you like money for for your solutions  you want to make cheaper solutions for you.
- Yeah, now, in the future, if you guys start making different types of products, if it becomes real parent that yeah we're going to need that tool, you can always add it later.

4. Section (0:29:51–0:39:51)
- Is that correct?
- There's some extra steps, if you just simply delete an ingredient, because this this the program has stored this particular product with 33 pound or 33% of ingredient number 40 wheat myths right.
- It would display it like it would protein or fat or fiber you could have a density density nutrient and it would be the value would be linear because you're not able to program in the nonlinear aspect of, you know, any kind of particle size  relationship, which would affect the true density.
- And they really go through great pains to to process all of their ingredients like the nitrogen the ammonium the urea the so that they all have a very similar particle size and shaped or like little round BBs little pellets, so that when they mix them  they get a homogenous mixture that they can come to a close approximation on density.

5. Section (0:39:51–0:47:54)
- Yeah, you probably don't maybe care about that but I don't answer I don't I don't always answer that question yes no problem because  just humans.
- Yeah, if you have other questions or I don't know if Mark offered or mentioned to you that you can get a trial, a free 30 day trial of the program so you can start experimenting with you know your solutions your actual information.
- But yeah, I mean if you've got a laboratory where that has an export of data is sometimes the important ingredient nutrient values ingredient costs are probably the most common piece of information that gets imported in.
- There's different there's some differences in in exporting methods that depending on how you want to use that information if you just wanted to copy a report and paste it into a Word document or an email or something then you could do that with like just a you know pasting or copying a report.
